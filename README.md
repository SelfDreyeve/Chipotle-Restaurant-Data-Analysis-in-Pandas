# Chipotle-Restaurant-Data-Analysis-in-Pandas
Analysing Chiptle dataset containing details of a few thousand orders to find out what is an average order composed of, most common picks etc.

In this analysis I'm going to answer the following questions: 1) What is the general distribution of the total order value? What does a typical order cost?

2) What are some typical combinations in most orders. This can tell us if Chipotle should create meals so that the customer can just point to meal 1 (chips, burrito, drink) or meal 2, etc.

3) Given a specific item, what has been ordered most frequently with it? This can help create a digital ordering menu that makes it easy for a customer to select items as they choose the first item, they get shown the second item, etc, based on historical data.
